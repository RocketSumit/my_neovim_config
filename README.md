# my_neovim_config
This is my neovim config. Here's how you can use it. 
*Clean out your neovim configs and plugins. 
*Install vim-plug (place plug.vim in your ~/.config/nvim/autoload dir) 
*Place init.vim in ~/.config/nvim/ Launch nvim (I have it aliased to vim) and run :PlugInstall 
*Wait for the plugins to install, :q out of the Plug installation window, and enjoy!
